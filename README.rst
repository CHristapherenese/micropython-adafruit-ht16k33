================================================

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting the use of our CircuitPython libraries for use with Python.

Please see the CircuitPython library for using HT16K33 with microcontrollers: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HT16K33
